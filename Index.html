      <p>My name is Gaya and I am a London-based pianist, accompanist, piano and voice teacher, <br>
        singer, songwriter and composer. In 2015, after 5 years of teaching as a travelling tutor, <br>
        I decided to start Isleworth Music Studio, which since then has
        welcomed many students <br> who work towards graded exams or simply learn music for their own enjoyment! </p></td>
